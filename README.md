TOPP FOR RIGID-BODY MOTIONS
------------

We implemented Time-Optimal Path Parameterization (TOPP) for rigid-body trajectories subject to angular velocities, accelerations and torques bounds.

For further details, please see more at our paper <<link to paper>>

Requirements
------------

-As this implementation is an extention of TOPP (time-optimal Path Parameterization), read instructions in following link to install TOPP, OpenRAVE and prerequisites:
https://github.com/quangounet/TOPP

-Clone this TOPP-SO3 folder and it's ready to use!

Examples
------------
Please try the test files in the folder (test-SO3.py and test-SE3.py)
